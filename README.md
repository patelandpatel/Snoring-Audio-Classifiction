# Snoring Detection using CNN

## Overview
This project aims to detect snoring sounds using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Snoring is a common problem that affects sleep quality and can indicate underlying health issues. By developing a CNN model, this project seeks to automatically detect snoring events in audio recordings, providing a tool for sleep analysis and monitoring.

## Features
- Train a CNN model to classify audio segments as snoring or non-snoring.
- Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Provide scripts for preprocessing audio data, training the model, and making predictions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Librosa (for audio processing)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- seaborn
